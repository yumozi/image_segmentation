Run "run.py" to use the program.

run.py takes two optional arguments, "--save/-s" and "--display/-d", which are both set to False by default. Setting --save to True will make the program save masks to the OUTPUT_PATH defined in run.py. Setting --display to True will make the program display each mask after it's done processing.
