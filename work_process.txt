I first experimented with simple grayscale thresholding, but quickly realized that due to various lighting conditions, it is difficult to distinguish the barrel from its surroundings using grayscale threshold. 

I moved on to try to use HSV threshold instead. I first attempted to use detect using orange colors, but it wasn't working. I then realized the barrels aren't really orange...they are red. What's more, they are red that's located near the end of the HSV spectrum. After obtaining the rough HSV values for a barrel from an image, I used those values and barrel begun to show up on my masks.

I tried my code on a number of images and obtained varying degrees of success. At this point, there were two problems. 
1. Sometimes the mask of the barrel isn't perfect, with black noises scattered around in the mask. 
2. Sometimes other objects are considered to be a barrel as well and was included in the mask. 
My plan is to widen the detection range so that I can 100% capture the shape of all barrels. After that, I will perform more operations on the mask (maybe with edge or shape detection) to distinguish the barrel. 

While finetuning the threshold by hand, I found out that a high brightness threshold helps to make most masks more crisp, at the cost of making one image's mask do terribly. I still went with a higher threshold, and maybe come back later to deal with the special case. 

After some research, I decided to use closing to remove the noises inside barrel instances in masks. After that, I also used opening to remove the smaller white noises outside the barrel instances. At this point, I have easily distinguishable barrer masks for most images, although sometimes with larger chunks of white noises.
